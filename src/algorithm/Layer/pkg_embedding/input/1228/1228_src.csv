the diagnostics support that is part of the C++11 standard library.
Boost.Jam (BJam) is the low-level build engine tool for Boost.Build.
Historically, Boost.Jam is based on on FTJam and on Perforce Jam but has grown
a number of significant features and is now developed independently.
This package contains example source files distributed with boost.
Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  The
emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
Library, in the hopes of establishing ""existing practice"" for
extensions and providing reference implementations so that the Boost
libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
libraries have already been included in the C++ 2011 standard and
others have been proposed to the C++ Standards Committee for inclusion
in future standards.)
Run-time support for Boost.Coroutine, a library that provides
generalized subroutines which allow multiple entry points for
suspending and resuming execution.

Run-time support for the Parallel BGL graph library.  The interface and
graph components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard
Template Library (STL).  This libraries in this package use MPICH
back-end to do the parallel work.

Run-time support for the Boost Fiber library, a framework for
micro-/userland-threads (fibers) scheduled cooperatively.

Python 3 support for Boost.MPI-OpenMPI, a library providing a clean C++
API over the OpenMPI implementation of MPI.

and highly configurable implementation of the mandated C99/C++
preprocessor functionality.

Run-time support for Boost.Locale, a set of localization and Unicode
handling tools.

Run-time support for the BGL graph library.  BGL interface and graph
components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard Template
Library (STL).

C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes,
functions and objects to Python, and vice versa, using no special
tools -- just your C++ compiler.  This package contains run-time
support for the NumPy extension of the Boost Python Library for Python 3.

Run-time component of the Boost stacktrace library.

Run-time component Boost.Thread library, which provides classes and
functions for managing multiple threads of execution, and for
synchronizing data between the threads or providing separate copies of
data specific to individual threads.

graph components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard
Template Library (STL).  This libraries in this package use OpenMPI
back-end to do the parallel work.

Run-time support of boost program options library, which allows program
developers to obtain (name, value) pairs from the user, via
conventional methods such as command-line and configuration file.

Run-time support for Boost.Iostreams, a framework for defining streams,
stream buffers and i/o filters.

Run-time support for Boost Date Time, a set of date-time libraries based
on generic programming concepts.

Boost.Container library implements several well-known containers,
including STL containers. The aim of the library is to offer advanced
features not present in standard containers or to offer the latest
standard draft features for compilers that comply with C++03.
Static Boost C++ libraries.

The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes,
functions and objects to Python, and vice versa, using no special
tools -- just your C++ compiler.  This package contains run-time
support for the Boost Python Library compiled for Python 3.

The Boost.TypeErasure library provides runtime polymorphism in C++
that is more flexible than that provided by the core language.

Run-time support for serialization for persistence and marshaling.

Run-time support for managed signals & slots callback implementation.

""How long does my C++ code take to run?""
The Boost Timer library answers that question and does so portably,
with as little as one #include and one additional line of code.

Run-time support for Boost.Atomic, a library that provides atomic data
types and operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
variables.

Python 3 support for Boost.MPI-MPICH, a library providing a clean C++
API over the MPICH implementation of MPI.

Run-time support for boost random library.

Run-time support for Boost.MPI-OpenMPI, a library providing a clean C++
API over the OpenMPI implementation of MPI.

application developer.  It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
tools along with public interfaces for extending the library.
Boost.Build is an easy way to build C++ projects, everywhere. You name
your pieces of executable and libraries and list their sources.  Boost.Build
takes care about compiling your sources with the right options,
creating static and shared libraries, making pieces of executable, and other
chores -- whether you're using GCC, MSVC, or a dozen more supported
C++ compilers -- on Windows, OSX, Linux and commercial UNIX systems.

implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language

files compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).

This package contains a forked version of vzic for internal use by the Cyrus
IMAP server.
The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

dwarves,,,"dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

protocol, as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows Network Access
Servers (NAS boxes) to perform authentication for dial-up users. There are
also RADIUS clients available for Web servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and
more.  Using RADIUS allows authentication and authorization for a network to
be centralized, and minimizes the amount of re-configuration which has to be
done when adding or deleting new users.

Cpp is a macro processor which is used automatically
by the C compiler to transform your program before actual
compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows
you to define macros, abbreviations for longer
constructs.

The C preprocessor provides four separate functionalities: the
inclusion of header files (files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros,
and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions
throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use
a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate
file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

You should install this package if you are a C programmer and you use
macros.

or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file systems in
terms of features and extensibility.  It borrows a powerful concept
called Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS
is in user space and easily manageable.

designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same

","A sanserif typeface family
",lato-fonts,"Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a

",libffi,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be

Virt-customize is a command line tool for customizing virtual machine
disk images.

Virt-df is a command line tool to display free space on virtual
machine filesystems.  Unlike other tools, it doesn__ just display the
amount of space allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside
the virtual machine to see how much space is really being used.  It is
like the df(1) command, but for virtual machines, except that it also
works for Windows virtual machines.

Virt-diff shows the differences between virtual machines.

Virt-edit is a command line tool to edit the contents of a file in a
virtual machine.

Virt-filesystems is a command line tool to display the filesystems,
partitions, block devices, LVs, VGs and PVs found in a disk image
or virtual machine.  It replaces the deprecated programs
virt-list-filesystems and virt-list-partitions with a much more
capable tool.

Virt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks.

Virt-get-kernel extracts a kernel/initrd from a disk image.

Virt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the
version of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed,
whether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or
para-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more.

Virt-log is a command line tool to display the log files from a
virtual machine.

Virt-ls is a command line tool to list out files in a virtual machine.

Virt-make-fs is a command line tool to build a filesystem out of
a collection of files or a tarball.

Virt-rescue provides a rescue shell for making interactive,
unstructured fixes to virtual machines.

Virt-resize can resize existing virtual machine disk images.

Virt-sparsify makes virtual machine disk images sparse (thin-provisioned).

Virt-sysprep lets you reset or unconfigure virtual machines in
preparation for cloning them.

Virt-tail follows (tails) a log file within a guest, like 'tail -f'.

Virt-tar-in and virt-tar-out are archive, backup and upload tools
for virtual machines.  These replace the deprecated program virt-tar.

Virt-win-reg lets you look at and modify the Windows Registry of
Windows virtual machines.

dependencies required by libguestfs to pull icons out of non-Linux
guests.  Install this package if you want libguestfs to be able to
inspect non-Linux guests and display icons from them.

disk images.  http://libguestfs.org

It can be used to make batch configuration changes to guests, get
disk used/free statistics (virt-df), migrate between hypervisors
(virt-p2v, virt-v2v), perform backups and guest clones, change
registry/UUID/hostname info, build guests from scratch (virt-builder)
and much more.

linking.  You don't need this, unless you link statically, which
is highly discouraged.
libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt.

chosen both because it is a synonym of surefire and because it implies
that when it fails, it does so in a safe way.

If you use the Surefire Plugin for running tests, then when you have a
test failure, the build will stop at the integration-test phase and
your integration test environment will not have been torn down

NBD is a protocol for accessing block devices (hard disks and
disk-like things) over the network.

nbdkit is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

* Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

* Minimal dependencies for the basic server.

* Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
  libraries or included in proprietary code.

* Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
  Lets you to export ""unconventional"" block devices easily.

* You can write plugins in C or many other languages.

* Filters can be stacked in front of plugins to transform the output.

'nbdkit' is a meta-package which pulls in the core server and a
useful subset of plugins and filters with minimal dependencies.

If you want just the server, install 'nbdkit-server'.

To develop plugins, install the 'nbdkit-devel' package and start by
reading the nbdkit(1) and nbdkit-plugin(3) manual pages.

",nbdkit,"NBD is a protocol for accessing block devices (hard disks and
disk-like things) over the network.

nbdkit is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

* Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

* Minimal dependencies for the basic server.

* Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
  libraries or included in proprietary code.

* Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
  Lets you to export ""unconventional"" block devices easily.

* You can write plugins in C or many other languages.

* Filters can be stacked in front of plugins to transform the output.

'nbdkit' is a meta-package which pulls in the core server and a
useful subset of plugins and filters with minimal dependencies.

If you want just the server, install 'nbdkit-server'.

To develop plugins, install the 'nbdkit-devel' package and start by

Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.

PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular

PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of
functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one
for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for
the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++
wrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8
encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.

The distribution does contain a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit
library that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix
man page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that
this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions

Utilities for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications.
Macros for rpmbuild are needed during build of srpm in koji. This
sub-package must be installed into buildroot, so it will be needed
by perl. Perl is needed because of git.
The Test Perl module simplifies the task of writing test files for Perl modules,
such that their output is in the format that Test::Harness expects to see.
This Perl module tells its users that functions in a package are to be
autoloaded from after the ""__DATA__"" token. See also ""Autoloading"" in
perlsub.
Net::Ping module contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on
a network.
writemain() takes an argument list of directories containing archive libraries
that relate to perl modules and should be linked into a new perl binary. It
writes a corresponding perlmain.c file that is a plain C file containing all
the bootstrap code to make the If the first argument to writemain() is a
reference to a scalar it is used as the filename to open for ouput. Any other
reference is used as the filehandle to write to. Otherwise output defaults to
STDOUT.
The Time::Piece module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
with implementations that return objects.  It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime or gmtime as documented in perlfunc still
behave as expected.
The is a perl run-time (interpreter as a shared library and include
directories).
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter.

If your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with
""perl(MODULE)"" where ""MODULE"" is a name of required module. E.g. install
""perl(Test::More)"" to make Test::More Perl module available.

If you need all the Perl modules that come with upstream Perl sources, so
called core modules, install perl-core package.

If you only need perl run-time as a shared library, i.e. Perl interpreter
embedded into another application, the only essential package is perl-libs.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

Perl utils like ""splain"" or ""perlbug"" can be found in perl-utils package.
This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, designed
to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module authors.
This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib package.
The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object in much the same way
as an IO::File object so you can have common code that doesn't know which sort
of file it is using.
This is a dummy package to improve a compatibility with future Perls that will use
this package to deliver /usr/bin/perl Perl interpreter.
The libnetcfg utility can be used to configure the libnet.
This package converts files from POD format (see perlpod) to HTML format. It
can automatically generate indexes and cross-references, and it keeps a cache
of things it knows how to cross-reference.
Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the
__DATA__ token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs
correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get
loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.
The ""open"" pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default ""layers""
(also known as ""disciplines"") for all I/O.
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.
Several utilities which come with Perl distribution like c2ph, h2ph, perlbug,
perlthanks, pl2pm, pstruct, and splain. Some utilities are provided by more
specific packages like perldoc by perl-Pod-Perldoc.
This Perl module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables and
subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages derived from
that package may be given attributes with the same names as the attribute
handler subroutines, which will then be called in one of the compilation
phases (i.e. in a ""BEGIN"", ""CHECK"", ""INIT"", or ""END"" block).
Devel::Peek contains functions which allows raw Perl datatypes to be
manipulated from a Perl script. This is used by those who do XS programming to
check that the data they are sending from C to Perl looks as they think it
should look.
Memoizing a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does
this by caching the return values of the function in a table. If you call
the function again with the same arguments, memoize jumps in and gives
you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute
the value all over again.
""Errno"" defines and conditionally exports all the error constants defined in
your system ""errno.h"" include file. It has a single export tag, "":POSIX"",
which will export all POSIX defined error numbers.
This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl
limits itself to real numbers, but an extra ""use"" statement brings full
complex support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.
This is a collection of Perl input/output modules.

templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward
and flexible models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python
calling and scoping semantics.

librdmacm provides a userspace RDMA Communication Management API.
The ibacm daemon helps reduce the load of managing path record lookups on
large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what
is functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of ibacm, when properly
configured, can reduce the SA packet load of a large IB cluster from O(n^2)
to O(n).  The ibacm daemon is started and normally runs in the background,
user applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app
uses librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm
library knows how to talk directly to the ibacm daemon to retrieve data.

discover and use SCSI devices via the SCSI RDMA Protocol over InfiniBand.

by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending

Ruby provides built-in support for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
For example:

42**13 -> 1265437718438866624512

BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating
point numbers. Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation,
because it provides the correct answers people expect__hereas normal binary
floating point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the
conversion between base 10 and base 2.
Provides telnet client functionality.

This class also has, through delegation, all the methods of a socket object
(by default, a TCPSocket, but can be set by the Proxy option to new()). This
provides methods such as close() to end the session and sysread() to read data
directly from the host, instead of via the waitfor() mechanism. Note that if
you do use sysread() directly when in telnet mode, you should probably pass
the output through preprocess() to extract telnet command sequences.
Psych is a YAML parser and emitter. Psych leverages
libyaml[http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML] for its YAML parsing and emitting

Packages providing XML parsing, UTF-8 parsing, Unicode

A pair of documents to reveal the font features supported by
fonts usable in XeTeX. Use OpenType-info.tex for OpenType
fonts, and AAT-info.tex for AAT fonts (Mac OS X only).
texconfig allows one to configure and maintain TeX in an easy
and convenient manner, offering a series of dialog boxes to
the user. The directory in which texconfig is found is also
preferentially used to find subprograms.
The package provides support for the manipulation and reference
of small or 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or
table environment. It is convenient to use this package when
your subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or
are to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure
command is introduced which can be used inside a figure
environment for each subfigure. An optional first argument is
used as the caption for that subfigure. This package supersedes
the subfigure package (which will continue to be supported, but
no longer maintained). The name has changed because the subfig
package is not completely backward compatible with the older
subfigure package due to an extensive rewrite to use the new
caption package to produce its subcaptions. The major advantage
to the new package is that the user interface is keyword/value
driven and easier to use. To ease the transition from the
subfigure package it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)
which nearly emulates the subfigure package.
Allows LaTeX constructions (equations, picture environments,
etc.) to be precisely superimposed over Encapsulated PostScript
figures, using your own favorite drawing tool to create an EPS
figure and placing simple text 'tags' where each replacement is
to be placed, with PSfrag automatically removing these tags
from the figure and replacing them with a user specified LaTeX
construction, properly aligned, scaled, and/or rotated.
This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to 'clone' the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.
This package provides a way to typeset LaTeX source code and
the related result in the same document.
The package provides emulation of pdfTeX primitives for LuaTeX
v0.85+.
The lettrine package supports various dropped capitals styles,
typically those described in the French typographic books. In
particular, it has facilities for the paragraph text's left
edge to follow the outline of capitals that have a regular
shape (such as ""A"" and ""V"").
Martin Vogel's Symbol font (marvosym) contains the Euro
currency symbol as defined by the European commission, along
with symbols for structural engineering; symbols for steel
cross-sections; astronomy signs (sun, moon, planets); the 12
signs of the zodiac; scissor symbols; CE sign and others. The
package contains both the original TrueType font and the
derived Type 1 font, together with support files for TeX
(LaTeX).
The varwidth environment is superficially similar to minipage,
but the specified width is just a maximum value -- the box may
get a narrower ""natural"" width.
The bundle comprises: - authblk, which permits footnote style
author/affiliation input in the \author command, - balance, to
balance the end of \twocolumn pages, - figcaps, to send figure
captions, etc., to end document, - fullpage, to set narrow page
margins and set a fixed page style, and - sublabel, which
permits counters to be subnumbered.
The package provides commands that display the value of a LaTeX
counter in a variety of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal,
decimal, octal, binary etc). The package offers some
multilingual support; configurations for use in English (both
British and American usage), French (including Belgian and
Swiss variants), German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish
documents are provided. This package was originally provided as
part of the author's datetime package, but is now distributed
separately.
The commands \import{full_path}{file} and
\subimport{path_extension}{file} set up input through standard
LaTeX mechanisms (\input, \include and \includegraphics) to
load files relative to the \import-ed directory. There are also
\includefrom, \subincludefrom, and * variants of the commands.
LaTeX is a widely-used macro package for TeX, providing many
basic document formating commands extended by a wide range of
packages. It is a development of Leslie Lamport's original
LaTeX 2.09, and superseded the older system in June 1994. The
basic distribution is catalogued separately, at latex-base;
apart from a large set of contributed packages and third-party
documentation (elsewhere on the archive), the distribution
includes: - a bunch of required packages, which LaTeX authors
are ""entitled to assume"" will be present on any system running
LaTeX; and - a minimal set of documentation detailing
differences from the 'old' version of LaTeX in the areas of
user commands, font selection and control, class and package
writing, font encodings, configuration options and modification
of LaTeX. For downloading details, see the linked catalogue
entries above.
Provides support for the manipulation and reference of small or
'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or table
environment. It is convenient to use this package when your
subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are
to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure command
is introduced which can be used inside a figure environment for
each subfigure. An optional first argument is used as the
caption for that subfigure. This package is now obsolescent:
new users should use subfig instead.
Latin Modern Math is a maths companion for the Latin Modern
family of fonts, in OpenType format. For use with LuaLaTeX or
XeLaTeX, support is available from the unicode-math package.
The package allows the to user select any font size (via e.g.
\fontsize{...}{...}\selectfont), even those sizes that are not
listed in the .fd file. If such a size is requested, LaTeX will
search for and select the nearest listed size; anyfontsize will
then scale the font to the size actually requested. Similar
functionality is available for the CM family, for the EC
family, or for either computer modern encoding; the present
package generalises the facility.
The package allows the user to include several bibliographies
covering different 'topics' or bibliographic material into a
document (e.g., one bibliography for primary literature and one
for secondary literature). The package provides commands to
include either all references from a .bib file, only the
references actually cited or those not cited in your document.
The user has to construct a separate .bib file for each
bibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed
separately by BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies
specific to one part of a document, see the packages bibunits
or chapterbib.
Typewriter-style fonts are best for program listings, but
Computer Modern Typewriter prints ` and ' as bent opening and
closing single quotes. Other fonts, and most programming
languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used
both to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches
the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1
encoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,
\verb, and \verb* to print in the ""` and ' way"". It does
thisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as
the package is loaded after the other fonts were. The package
does not affect \tt, \texttt, etc.
The package was designed to accommodate all needs for inclusion
of graphics in LaTeX documents, replacing many earlier packages
used in LaTeX 2.09. The package aims to give a consistent
interface to including the file types that are understood in
your output, by use of 'printer drivers' (now known, simply, as
'drivers'). The distribtion of the package contains several
drivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed
separately. The package also offers several means of
manipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a
document (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended
documentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics
bundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX 'required'
set of packages.
This package exposes spacing parameters for various TeX logos
to the end user, to optimise the logos for different fonts.
Written especially for XeLaTeX users.
Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-
8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in
older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
the older patterns.
The package provides the switch \ifetex which indicates whether
e-TeX is available or not. The package can be loaded as LaTeX
package using \usepackage{ifetex} or in plain TeX using \input
ifetex. In either case it aborts silently if the \ifetex macro
is already defined. The package's test is whether \eTeXversion
is defined as a primitive; if it is, the package assumes e-TeX
features are available.
Starting with PDF 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.0), PDF files can
contain file attachments -- arbitrary files that a reader can
extract, just like attachments to an e-mail message. The
attachfile package brings this functionality to pdfLaTeX and
provides some additional features not available in Acrobat,
such as the ability to use arbitrary LaTeX code for the file
icon -- including things like \includegraphics, tabular, and
mathematics. Settings can be made either globally or on a per-
attachment basis. Attachfile makes it easy to attach files and
customize their appearance in the enclosing document. The
package supports the Created, Modified, and Size keys in the
EmbeddedFile's Params dictionary.
This package contains the files needed to get the TeX Live
tools (notably tlmgr) running: perl modules, xz binaries, plus
(sometimes) tar and wget.  These files end up in the standalone
install packages, and in the tlcritical repository.
The package patches a few commands of the LaTeX2e kernel and
the amsmath and mathtools packages to be more compatible with
the LuaTeX engine. It is only meaningful for LuaLaTeX documents
containing mathematical formulas, and does not exhibit any new
functionality. The fixes are mostly moved from the unicode-math
package to this package since they are not directly related to
Unicode mathematics typesetting.
The philokalia package has been designed to ease the use of the
Philokalia-Regular OpenType font with XeLaTeX. The font started
as a project to digitize the typeface used to typeset the
Philokalia books.
LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an
embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX project's main
objective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX
while at the same time offering downward compatibility. LuaTeX
uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and is
able to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and
mathematics). It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under
development; its specification has been declared stable, but
absolute stability may not in practice be assumed.
Adds line numbers to selected paragraphs with reference
possible through the LaTeX \ref and \pageref cross reference
mechanism. Line numbering may be extended to footnote lines,
using the fnlineno package.
This package extends the ifthen package by implementing new
commands to go within the first argument of \ifthenelse: to
test whether a string is void or not, if a command is defined
or equivalent to another. The package also enables use of
complex expressions as introduced by the package calc, together
with the ability of defining new commands to handle complex
tests. The package requires e-TeX features.
A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'
PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the
(obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must
have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts
to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex
package tries to compensate for the visual differences between
the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete.
This collection of tools includes: - support for short commands
starting with @, - macros to sanitise the OT1 encoding of the
cmtt fonts; - a 'do after' command; - improved footnote
support; - mathenv for various alignment in maths; - list
handling; - mdwmath which adds some minor changes to LaTeX
maths; - a rewrite of LaTeX's tabular and array environments; -
verbatim handling; and - syntax diagrams.
Defines a command \captionof for putting a caption to something
that's not a float. Note that the caption package includes a
\captionof command that is an extension of that provided by
this package.
EncTeX is (another) tex extension, written at the change-file
level. It provides means of translating input on the way into
TeX. It allows, for example, translation of multibyte
sequences, such as utf-8 encoding.
Packages to convert LaTeX to XML/HTML, and typeset XML/SGML.
Provides commands to typeset centered, left- or right-aligned
table and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes. Instead of
an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the first
is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.
The package contains the Bera Type 1 fonts, and a zip archive
containing files to use the fonts with LaTeX. Bera is a set of
three font families: Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans
(a Frutiger descendant), and Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter).
Support for use in LaTeX is also provided. The Bera family is a
repackaging, for use with TeX, of the Bitstream Vera family.
The l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental
implementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with
higher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them
work as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and
can be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing
kernel. The present release includes: - xgalley, which controls
boxes receiving text for typesetting. - l3dt: kernel support
for data tables; - l3galley: kernel support for xgalley; -
l3regex: kernel support for regular expression search and
replace operations; - l3sort: kernel support for sorting
sequences, token lists or comma-lists, according to user-
specified comparison criteria; - l3str: kernel support for
string manipulation; - l3tl-build: kernel support for token
list building; - l3tl_analysis: kernel support for token list
analysis; and - xcoffins, which allows the alignment of boxes
using a series of 'handle' positions, supplementing the simple
TeX reference point. All the files of the bundle are also
available in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3
Project.
Pst-coil is a PSTricks based package for coils and zigzags and
for coil and zigzag node connections.
This is the basic TeX Live scheme: it is a small set of files
sufficient to typeset plain TeX or LaTeX documents in
PostScript or PDF, using the Computer Modern fonts.  This
scheme corresponds to collection-basic and collection-latex.
Can handle almost all of HTML2, and most of the math fragment
of the draft HTML3.
MnSymbol is a symbol font family, designed to be used in
conjunction with Adobe Minion Pro (via the MinionPro package).
Almost all of LaTeX and AMS mathematical symbols are provided;
remaining coverage is available from the MinionPro font with
the MinionPro package. The fonts are available in both MetaFont
and Adobe Type 1 formats, and a comprehensive support package
is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with Minon
Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or
baroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts
that are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or
Times; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package
designed to configure its use with any font other than Minion
Pro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo
will probably do what is needed.
Macro package on top of LaTeX to typeset TeX output of the Jade
DSSSL implementation.
The package provides commands to change the page layout in the
middle of a document, and to robustly check for typesetting on
odd or even pages. Instructions for use are at the end of the
file. The package is an extraction of code from the memoir
class, whose user interface it shares. It is intended the this
package will eventually replace the chngpage package, which is
distributed with the package.
The caption package provides many ways to customise the
captions in floating environments like figure and table, and
cooperates with many other packages. Facilities include
rotating captions, sideways captions, continued captions (for
tables or figures that come in several parts). A list of
compatibility notes, for other packages, is provided in the
documentation. The package also provides the ""caption outside
float"" facility, in the same way that simpler packages like
capt-of do. The package supersedes caption2.
Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
mathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are
distributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts
distribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer
Modern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the
European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.
This package provides the command \marginnote that may be used
instead of \marginpar at almost every place where \marginpar
cannot be used, e.g., inside floats, footnotes, or in frames
made with the framed package.
Provides enumerate and itemize environments that can be used
within paragraphs to format the items either as running text or
as separate paragraphs with a preceding number or symbol. Also
provides compacted versions of enumerate and itemize.
A bundle of packages that arise in the author's area of
interest: - compliance of maths typesetting with ISO standards;
- symbols that work in both maths and text modes; - commas for
both decimal separator and maths; and - upright Greek letters
in maths.
The package provides an \ul (underline) command which will
break over line ends; this technique may be used to replace \em
(both in that form and as the \emph command), so as to make
output look as if it comes from a typewriter. The package also
offers double and wavy underlining, and striking out (line
through words) and crossing out (/// over words). The package
works with both Plain TeX and LaTeX.
The package provides lipsum-like facilities for the Persian
language. The source of the filling text is the Persian epic
""the Shanameh"" (100 paragraphs are used.)
Designed for use with xdvi and dvips this utility converts
Adobe Type 1 fonts to PK bitmap format. It should not
ordinarily be much used nowadays, since both its target
applications are now capable of dealing with Type 1 fonts,
direct.
cmextra package
The T2 bundle provides a variety of separate support functions,
for using Cyrillic characters in LaTeX: - the mathtext package,
for using Cyrillic letters 'transparently' in formulae - the
citehack package, for using Cyrillic (or indeed any non-ascii)
characters in citation keys; - support for Cyrillic in BibTeX;
- support for Cyrillic in Makeindex; and - various items of
font support.
ifoddpage package
Typeset programs (programming code) within LaTeX. The source
code is read directly by TeX. Keywords, comments and strings
can be typeset using different styles (default is bold for
keywords, italic for comments and no special style for
strings). Includes support for hyperref. To use, simply
\usepackage{listings}, identify the language with
\lstset{language=Python}, then employ the \begin{lstlisting}
... \end{lstlisting} environment or the
\lstinputlisting{filename.py} command. Short (in-line) listings
are also available, using either \lstinline|...| or | ... |
(after defining the | token with the \lstMakeShortInline
command).
ltxmisc package
A general purpose hierarchical index generator; it accepts one
or more input files (often produced by a text formatter such as
TeX or troff), sorts the entries, and produces an output file
which can be formatted. The formats of the input and output
files are specified in a style file; by default, input is
assumed to be an .idx file, as generated by LaTeX.
The KOMA-Script bundle provides drop-in replacements for the
article/report/book classes with emphasis on typography and
versatility. There is also a letter class, different from all
other letter classes. It also offers e.g. a package for
calculated type areas in the way laid down by the typographer
Jan Tschichold, a package for easily changing and defining of
page styles, a package for getting not only the current date
but also the name of day and a package for getting current
time. All these packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script
classes but also with standard classes. Since every package has
its own version number, the number below is only the version of
scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea. These are
the main parts of the bundle.
Pst-fill is a PSTricks-based package for filling and tiling
areas or characters.
The package offers access to the large number of web-related
icons provided by the included font. The package requires the
package, fontspec, if run with XeTeX or LuaTeX.
The package loads the fixltx2e package from the LaTeX
distribution, and etex.sty from the e-TeX distribution. The
package then patches the \- (discretionary hyphen command) to
use the current hyphen character (which may be different from
than the default, which is the character at the ASCII hyphen
slot), and loads the realscripts to patch the \textsuperscript
command (from the LaTeX kernel) and the \textsubscript command
(from the fixltx2e package). The package is loaded by the
fontspec package, so that it should not ordinarily be necessary
to load it explicitly. The package relies on the metalogo
package for typesetting the XeTeX and XeLaTeX logos.
Provides a style with author-year and numbered references, as
well as much detailed of support for other bibliography use.
Provides versions of the standard BibTeX styles that are
compatible with natbib - plainnat, unsrtnat, abbrnat. The
bibliography styles produced by custom-bib are designed from
the start to be compatible with natbib.
The package provides a means of producing a 'book' of font
samples (for evaluation, etc.).
A collection of programs for processing the output of Metafont.
The package provides a map for use with Jonathan Kew's TECkit,
to translate Tibetan to Unicode (range 0F00-0FFF).
Includes install-tl, tl-portable, rungs, etc.; not needed for
tlmgr to run but still ours.  Not included in tlcritical.
This bundle provides a collection of model .ini files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to
introduced distribution-dependent variations in formats. They
are also used to allow existing format source files to be used
with newer engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source
file to work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.
The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing
commands in LaTeX to produce hypertext links in the document.
The package provides backends for the \special set defined for
HyperTeX DVI processors; for embedded pdfmark commands for
processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and Y&Y's dvipsone); for
Y&Y's dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTeX and dvipdfm; for
TeX4ht; and for VTeX's pdf and HTML backends. The package is
distributed with the backref and nameref packages, which make
use of the facilities of hyperref. The package depends on the
author's kvoptions, ltxcmdsand refcount packages.
The bundle holds prototype implementations of concepts for a
LaTeX designer interface, to be used with the experimental
LaTeX kernel as programming tools and kernel support. Packages
provided in this release are: - l3keys2e, which makes the
facilities of the kernel module l3keys available for use by
LaTeX 2e packages; - xfrac, which provides flexible split-level
fractions; - xparse, which provides a high-level interface for
declaring document commands; and - xtemplate, which provides a
means of defining generic functions using a key-value syntax.
All the files of the bundle are also available in the
Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3 Project.
This package has been withdrawn from CTAN, and bundled into the
distributions' package sets. The current sources of dvips may
be found in the distribution of dvipsk which forms part of the
TeX-live sources.
This package has all the code from the package pstricks-add
which was related to arrows, like multiple arrows and so on.
ArabXeTeX provides a convenient ArabTeX-like user-interface for
typesetting languages using the Arabic script in XeLaTeX, with
flexible access to font features. Input in ArabTeX notation can
be set in three different vocalization modes or in roman
transliteration. Direct UTF-8 input is also supported. The
parsing and converting of ArabTeX input to Unicode is done by
means of TECkit mappings. Version 1.0 provides support for
Arabic, Maghribi Arabic, Farsi (Persian), Urdu, Sindhi,
Kashmiri, Ottoman Turkish, Kurdish, Jawi (Malay) and Uighur.
The documentation (not yet complete) covers topics such as
typesetting the Holy Quran, typesetting bidirectional critical
editions (with ednotes), and information on various recommended
OpenType fonts for the Arabic script and for transliterating
Oriental languages.
This package can disable all hyphenation or enable hyphenation
of non-alphabetics or monospaced fonts. The package can also
enable hyphenation within 'words' that contain non-alphabetic
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., cmtt) fonts.
A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.
The package provides means of changing the layout of the
footnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --
the para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the
perpage option), to make footnotes disappear when an argument
moves (stable option) and to deal with multiple references to
footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package
also has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with
symbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the
package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.
The para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot
packages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.
(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved
by the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by
footnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage
A simple package which provides an \ifxetex conditional, so
that other code can determine that it is running under XeTeX.
The package requires the e-TeX extensions to the TeX primitive
set.
These are the wasy (Waldi symbol) fonts, second release. This
bundle presents the fonts in Metafont format, but they are also
available in Adobe Type 1 format. Support under LaTeX is
provided by the wasysym package.
Miscellaneous macros by Jorg Knappen, including: - represent
counters in greek; - Maxwell's non-commutative division; -
latin1jk, latin2jk and latin3jk, which are their inputenc
definition files that allow verbatim input in the respective
ISO Latin codes; - blackboard bold fonts in maths; - use of
RSFS fonts in maths; - extra alignments for \parboxes; - swap
Roman and Sans fonts; - transliterate semitic languages; -
patches to make (La)TeX formulae embeddable in SGML; - use
maths ""minus"" in text as appropriate; - simple Young tableaux.
norasi-c90 package
PostScript lacks a lot of basic operators such as tan, acos,
asin, cosh, sinh, tanh, acosh, asinh, atanh, exp (with e base).
Also (oddly) cos and sin use arguments in degrees. Pst-math
provides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with
wrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,
gauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for
the latter). pst-math is designed essentially to work with pst-
plot but can be used in whatever PS code (such as pstricks
SpecialCoor ""!"", which is useful for placing labels). The
package also provides a routine SIMPSON for numerical
integration and a solver of linear equation systems.
The package provides several file hooks (AtBegin, AtEnd, ...)
for files read by \input, \include and \InputIfFileExists.
General hooks for all such files (e.g. all \include'd ones) and
file specific hooks only used for named files are provided; two
hooks are provided for the end of \included files -- one
before, and one after the final \clearpage.
Provides variants of \fbox: \shadowbox, \doublebox, \ovalbox,
\Ovalbox, with helpful tools for using box macros and flexible
verbatim macros. You can box mathematics, floats, center,
flushleft, and flushright, lists, and pages.
The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical
citations, and also deals with various punctuation and other
issues of representation, including comprehensive management of
break points. The package is compatible with both hyperref and
backref. The package is (unsurprisingly) part of the cite
bundle of the author's citation-related packages.
A set of virtual fonts which emulates T1 coded fonts using the
standard CM fonts. The package name, AE fonts, supposedly
stands for ""Almost European"". The main use of the package was
to produce PDF files using Adobe Type 1 versions of the CM
fonts instead of bitmapped EC fonts. Note that direct
substitutes for the bitmapped EC fonts are now available, via
the CM-super, Latin Modern and (in a restricted way) CM-LGC
font sets.
manfnt-font package
teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, designed for ease of compilation, installation and
customisation. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no
longer be able to support, or to produce new versions of,
teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the ""schemes""
available when installing TeX live provides a configuration
very close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions
of programs and packages.
Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if ""called""
with the name dvipdfm, operates in a ""dvipdfm compatibility""
mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many ""PDF""
features as does pdfTeX. There being no documentation as such,
users are advised to consult the documentation of dvipdfm (as
well, of course, as the package Readme.
The pst-3d package provides basic macros for shadows, tilting
and three dimensional representations of text or graphical
objects.
The beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. Its

allows XMvn resolver to be used as Ivy resolver.
This package provides extensions for Apache Maven that can be used to
manage system artifact repository and use it to resolve Maven
artifacts in offline mode, as well as Maven plugins to help with
creating RPM packages containing Maven artifacts.
This package provides XMvn API module which contains public interface
for functionality implemented by XMvn Core.
This package provides XMvn Resolver, which is a very simple
commald-line tool to resolve Maven artifacts from system repositories.
Basically it's just an interface to artifact resolution mechanism
implemented by XMvn Core.  The primary intended use case of XMvn
Resolver is debugging local artifact repositories.
This package provides XMvn Bisect, which is a debugging tool that can
diagnose build failures by using bisection method.
This package provides minimal version of XMvn, incapable of using
remote repositories.
This package provides XMvn Install, which is a command-line interface
to XMvn installer.  The installer reads reactor metadata and performs
artifact installation according to specified configuration.
This package provides XMvn Tools parent POM.
